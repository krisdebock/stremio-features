Hello,
I have a question. Can you also give suggestions for an improvement with a new update? I have stremio version 4.4.168 on my laptop and stremio version v1.3.0 on my samsung tv.
1) On my laptop the text in a movie is more readable because the black border around the white letters is thicker than on my TV version. Sometimes I have difficulty reading the letters on tv because of this problem.
2) I have a subtitle addon opensubtitles v3+ version v0.0.4 and this works perfectly on my laptop version and does not work on TV because the synchronization is not accepted. Note, I mean v3plus, not v3
3) when playing a movie you see the network stats, the speed of loading a movie and how much is buffering on my laptop version. This is also very useful to know whether a movie plays well. 4) on my laptop version you can set the subtitle while the film is playing, which is also very handy, (which is possible in an android tv stremio version) while on the TV version you have to turn off the film and go to settings separately.

Can you submit these 4 points to the designers of stremio? It would also be very useful for many others if these problems would be solved in a new update of the version samsung TV v1.3.0
I am very grateful if you will consider these 4 questions and find a solution for this problem... thank you
